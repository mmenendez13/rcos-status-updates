﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿## Last Week's Accomplishments> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.> This week I set up a VNC connection for the Raspberry Pi to my laptop on my local network. I did this just to get familiar with a method for using the device on campus without the need for a monitor. I contributed to a tutorial document on how to set it up. I also started to plan out and develop pseudocode/code for the program we will embed onto the raspberry pi. ## This Week's Plan> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.> Next week, I plan on developing and debugging code to get our prototype to output proper data and send to our web server. ## Anything Blocking?> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.## Notes>
