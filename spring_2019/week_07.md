## Last Week's Accomplishments> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.>This past week I developed pseudocode to help get us running in terms of software development. I also met up with one of my partners Thursday night to get the hardware working. We spent two hours in the IoT lab trying to figure everything out. We unfortunately found out that the sensor we wanted to use is broken so we ordered a new one that will arrive Sunday.## This Week's Plan> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.>I plan on meeting with my group on Sunday when the sensor arrives and getting the hardware up and running. ## Anything Blocking?> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.> we broke our sensor and can not do much in terms of hardware. ## Notes> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
