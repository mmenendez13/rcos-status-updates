﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿## Last Week's Accomplishments> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.> This week I assisted in researching a way for everyone to access the raspberry pi from different networks so they can add code whenever they need. After discussing this goal, I thought it was best that this goal be scrapped. I have begun to develop pseudocode and actual code to start the embedded development of the device. I will be pushing these pieces of documentation onto GitHub as soon as I can. I also plan on learning more about SSH. ## This Week's Plan> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.> Next week, I plan on meeting with the hardware team for testing and coding sessions to make more advancements with the project. ## Anything Blocking?> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.>   I would consider the fact that we shifted the path of progress we wanted to make in terms of setting up a VNC for the raspberry pi a blocker because we wasted some time that we should not have. ## Notes> This was an insane week in terms of work load.
