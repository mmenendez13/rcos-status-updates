﻿﻿﻿﻿## Last Week's Accomplishments> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.> This past week my group mate gave me a few of the sensors that arrived to test out. I also researched some specifics about Raspberry Pi's in terms of best operating system to put on it. I also helped Liam install the OS onto the Raspberry Pi. ## This Week's Plan> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.>Next week, I plan on helping out with the testing of each sensor in order to choose the best route we can take in terms of sensor. I also plan on starting to program the Raspberry Pi to analyze data the sensors will send us. ## Anything Blocking?> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.>Monday schedule on Tuesday took away some time to work on the project.  ## Notes>
