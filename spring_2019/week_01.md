﻿﻿## Last Week's Accomplishments> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.> This past week I helped choose the hardware components we will be using to track the occupancy of a room. I also started to learn about the OS we will be using on a Raspberry Pi.## This Week's Plan> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.>Next week, we will be ordering parts. If the parts come in we will move forward in testing the components in terms of what data we are able to collect and how we will manage it. I will also look more into Debian than I did the week before. ## Anything Blocking?> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.>As of now, the only blocker is not having the physical components to work with, but that will change soon. ## Notes>
