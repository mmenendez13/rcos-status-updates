﻿﻿﻿## Last Week's Accomplishments> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.> This past week the new sensor we ordered came in. I was able to detect the I2C device on the raspberry pi which was great because it was not working before. I used a Git repository made for the sensor we are using (MLX90640) to get some output produced. It took some time for me to find the correct Linux commands, but after that I was able to get the program running and see what the sensor was outputting. I was very happy that I was able to get it working.  ## This Week's Plan> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.>Next week I plan on practicing for my groups presentation. I also plan on developing code to analyze the output data from the sensor and determine if someone is in a study room or not. I also hope to help program the connection between our device and the website that our software team has come up with. ## Anything Blocking?> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.> Big Algorithms test this week took up a lot of my time. ## Notes> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
