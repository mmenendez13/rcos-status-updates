We ordered a Raspberry Pi 3, Infrared PIR Motion Sensor Modules,  Ranging Detector Mod Distance Sensor, and another type of infrared sensor. They arrived on Friday 2/15/2019## This Week's Plan> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.>Next week, we plan to get the ball rolling for the hardware portion of this project. We plan to test each component's capabilities as well as setting up the operating system on the Raspberry Pi. ## Anything Blocking?> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.>The snow on Tuesday was a blocker, because we were unable to meet up and work on the project. Also, this week many group members had exams which took a lot of time away from FLOM. ## Notes> Excited for next week!
